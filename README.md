# Iris Flower Classification with Support Vector Machine

## Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification using the famous Iris Flower dataset. The goal is to train an SVM model to accurately classify iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their petal and sepal measurements.

## Dataset

- **Iris Flower Dataset:** The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each belonging to one of the three species mentioned above. The dataset includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
